## Description

`AtomS3` is a highly integrated programmable controller based on `ESP32-S3` main control, which integrates ESP32-S3 main control, integrated `WiFi` function, and `8M` on-chip FLASH; `0.85` inch `IPS screen`; `Programmable button function` at the bottom of the screen; Built-in 5V to 3.3V circuit, 6-axis gyro sensor `MPU6886`, on-board `Type-C` interface, power supply and firmware download, one `HY2.0-4P` expansion port, `6 GPIOs and power pins` reserved at the bottom to facilitate expansion applications. The product size is only `24*24mm`, which is suitable for various `embedded smart device applications`.

- `Reminder: If you need to burn the firmware, please press and hold the reset button (about 2 seconds) until the internal green LED lights up, then you can release it, at this time the device has entered download mode and waited for burning.`
